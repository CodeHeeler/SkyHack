# SkyHack
A roguelike inspired by Bethesda's Skyrim, done old-school Hack/NetHack style!

After exploring [NetHack code](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack), and looking to see whether anyone had done similar work in Python already, specifically Python 3, decided to start with the [Roguelike Tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) that uses [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod), and then build and expand from there.
